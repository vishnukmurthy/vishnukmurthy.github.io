  <b>10/10</b>
</p>
<p>
  Immediately after reading, I was going to give this one an 8/10. Namely because there is a slow section, and there's a lot to keep track of .
  However, within two days of finishing, the depth and genius of this book started to sink into my mind, and it would be an injustice to not give this book the full credit it deserves.
</p>
<p>
  This is a crime thriller, literary masterpiece, love story, and a philosophical treatise on the eternal conflicts that haunt the human experience all rolled into one.   We follow the protagonist Raskolnikov as he commits a double homicide in Soviet Russia and his following descent into insanity while he tries to avoid the authorities and justify his actions to himself.  In some sense this is a detective novel inverted. Instead of trying to catch the criminal, we know who the criminal is from the start, and we get to see everything through his eyes.

  <br><b>Favorite Quotes: </b>
</p>
<p>
  “Raskolnikov went into the passage and pulled the bell. The same bell, the same cracked note. He rang it a second and a third time; he listened and remembered. The hideous and agonizingly fearful sensation he had felt then began to come back to him more and more vividly. He shuddered at every ring and it gave him more and more satisfaction.” 
</p>
<p>
  “And although I cannot, I confess, in principle sympathise with private charity, for it not only fails to eradicate the evil but even promotes it, yet I must admit that I saw your action with pleasure—yes, yes, I like it.“
</p>
<p>
  “What is it, to run away! A mere formality; that’s not the main thing; no, he won’t run away on me by a law of nature, even if he has somewhere to run to. Have you ever seen a moth near a candle? Well, so he’ll keep circling around me, circling around me, as around a candle; freedom will no longer be dear to him, he’ll fall to thinking, get entangled, he’ll tangle himself all up as in a net, he’ll worry himself to death! . . . he’ll keep on making circles around me, narrowing the radius more and more, and—whop! He’ll fly right into my mouth, and I’ll swallow him, sir, and that will be most agreeable, heh, heh, heh!”
</p>
<p>
  “How it happened he himself did not know, but suddenly it was as if something lifted him and flung him down at her feet. He wept and embraced her knees. For the first moment she was terribly frightened, and her whole face went numb. She jumped up and looked at him, trembling. But all at once, in that same moment, she understood everything. Infinite happiness lit up in her eyes; she understood, and for her there was no longer any doubt that he loved her, loved her infinitely, and that at last the moment had come. . . .”

   <b>My Thoughts (Filled with Spoilers):</b>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>On Our Modern Conceptions of Love</em>
</p>
<p>
  The love affair between Raskolnikov and Sonia throws me off. Maybe it’s because I live in 2021 where we meet online, and love in media seems highly superficial, but the speed with which they fall in love and the intensity with which Sonia is willing to commit to Raskolnikov seems ludicrous. He’s a broke murderer and she’s a broke hooker, yet out of the goodness of his heart, he pays for her father’s funeral and one thing leads to another.  
</p>
<p>
  On the flip side, they are living in such extreme conditions, that the kindness they show each other truly has a much larger meaning than I can fathom given that I live in the materially extravagant US of A.  Despite their flaws, it is clear that they are both  kind and caring people, who are able to see, support, and accept each other fully. Sonia is the first person Raskolnikov openly confesses his murder to, and she still sees him as worth of redemption. Likewise, despite the fact that she's a hooker, Raskolnikov understands that Sonia had good reasons for being in her occupation and doesn't judge her for it. That ability to see and care for someone else despite what they have done might be all that love boils down to.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Thinking you’ll like doing something vs how you actually feel when you do it</em>
</p>
<p>
   I think we all have false notions about how we will like living in a new place, or a new hobby, girlfriend, or job. We all have a false set of expectations and it is challenging to know how we will feel about a thing before experiencing it. The double murder committed seems like taking this idea to the Nth degree.  - I keep thinking to Raskolnikov’s internal dialogue about how some people get away with murder like Napolean and are viewed on the side of Right, yet as he considers himself a Super human and tries to follow the chain of thought he ends up going psycho, and thinks he might be in the wrong. I have never thought about killing someone in the same way, but the struggle is somehow still relatable.
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>Donations vs Systemic Change.</em><br>
</p>
<p>
  The fact that they were arguing about the benefits and cons of donating back in 1866 makes me laugh. I often think about if philanthropy is helping or is just a band aid fix. There's been a lot of press around big philanthropy, particularly the show Hassan Minaj did on it, but I’ve decided that personally I would rather donate and do what I can to help, even if it doesn’t fix everything. 
</p>
<p>
  <em>Anti Semitism</em><br>
</p>
<p>
  One scene makes it clear that Dostoevsky hates on Jews. Why the hate bro?  I actually realized I don't understand the historical context behind Anti Semitism, and it's something I need to read more about. I knew that Hitler was playing on peoples existing prejudices, but this book was published in 1866 so I suspect the history goes back way farther than I thought.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Can You Really Run Away?</em>
</p>
<p>
  There’s the quote from Porfiry, about how Raskolnikov is like a moth to a flame and won’t run away because it is human nature. Once the murder happened in the book, I was thinking about how I would just try to run away with the money. However, that's not what Raskolnikov does. It reminds me of how Bonnie and Clyde, two of America's most notorious criminals were finally captured and killed while they were visiting family members.
</p>
<p>
  <em>People Need People</em>
</p>
<p>
  The ending scene, when Raskolnikov finally surrenders. To love, to Sonia, and to living in society despite his convictions is one of my favorite book endings of all time. It balances the juxtaposition we all have between thinking we are special and unique, but at the same time need other people in our lives; otherwise it’s all meaningless. If Covid has taught us anything, it's that people need people. I've also been thinking about some studies I've read that show most mass shooters are complete loners. They are living on the outskirts of society already and then they do these horrendous acts. Salvation for Raskolnikov comes in the form of accepting that he needs reintegration with society. Can we proactively help the weird loner kids who are poised to become killers? I like to think so.
