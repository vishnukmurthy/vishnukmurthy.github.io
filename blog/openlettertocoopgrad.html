Dear Co-op Graduate,
<p>
Congratulations!
</p>
<p>
I know this is not how you expected the end of your time in college to be, but I hope that despite the difficulties around us, you find the time to celebrate – you’ve earned it!
</p>
<p>
As you stand on the precipice of adulthood (or at least a new form of adulthood if you are a non-traditional student), I would like to offer a few words of advice that have served me well over the years and are particularly useful for a graduate from the Berkeley Co-ops.
</p>
<p>
Life after college can seem very daunting for a new grad, but in the face of whatever is to come, keep in mind that your attitude towards the situation is a powerful tool. You always have the ability to decide how to react to a given situation.
</p>
<p>
Choosing to accept the given constraints and doing whatever you can in the face of adversity, in combination with remaining grateful and hopeful, is the best medicine I’ve found to keeping my spirits high and preventing me from growing jaded.
</p>
<p>
As you spend time finding yourself and your sense of place in this world, there are going to be many instances when you have to make compromises. This is ok. No one thing in life defines you. We all contain multitudes, and have a variety of needs. All of which don’t need to be completely satisfied by the singularity of a job, partner, or anything else. Only you will know what your needs are, as well as where they can be satisfied. Other people may have good intentions with their advice on how to spend your energy, but you’re the only one with any skin in this game.
</p>
<p>
Particularly, as you craft a career for yourself, things may seem especially confusing. This is completely normal. Career planning is an ill-conditioned problem, and you can’t foresee how a small change in an initial condition or variable will result in a very different outcome down the road. All you can do is aim high and pursue your current path, while also being flexible to new information and internal value changes. I would also advise against using passion as the sole metric for career decision-making; it will follow if you put in the hard work. I’ve found that how much you enjoy the day-to-day, potential for mastery, and the ability of the career to support a desired lifestyle are much more important metrics for overall well being.
</p>
<p>
Finally, assuming you had as amazing of a time in the Co-ops as I did, leaving is going to be hard. This is probably one of the few places you’ve really loved, and yes that is special and should always be kept in the treasure trove of your heart.
However, that does not mean these were the best years of your life.
</p>
<p>
Every year has the potential to be the best year of your life, and the things that made your time in the co-ops so awesome: love, community, friendship, and a sense of adventure, are things that you can and should carry with you throughout your life. You should keep them close at all times, and share them with everyone who is worthy. This world needs a lot more exposure to these necessary ingredients for a well-lived life, and who better to help than you!
</p>
<p>
All the best my anonymous friend, wishing nothing but great things for you!
</p>
<p>
Sincerely Yours,
</p>
<p>
Vishnu K Murthy - A Cloyne Grad from 2017.
