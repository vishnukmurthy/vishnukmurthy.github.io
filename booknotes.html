          Immediately after reading, I was going to give this one an 8/10. Namely because there is a slow section, and there's a lot to keep track of.
          However, within two days of finishing, the depth and genius of this book started to sink into my mind, and it would be an injustice to not give this book the full credit it deserves.

          Overall, this book was a really fun, and well thought out sci fi read.          
          The premise is that a secret project by the Chinese government tries to make contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Once the humans get a response back, a fundamental question is explored, what do we as humans do if contact with aliens is made?
