          Solving for False Expectations (What is Work For)?

Recently, there was an article on the front page of the NY Times titled After Working at Google, I’ll Never Let Myself Love a Job Again, the subtitle goes on to say “I learned the hard way that no publicly traded company is a family”. Immediately, I was struck with the thought that the entire premise of this article was asinine. Who could ever equate a job with family?
</p>
<p>
Quickly, I remembered that I was in no position to judge, as I had been guilty of a similar folly not too long ago. Instead of looking for love from a company, I had wanted something from my startup job that was equally ludicrous – to give back to the world by trying to solve a fundamentally political issue: transitioning to clean energy.
</p>
<p>
At a high level, the problem is that I was looking to fulfill some need in the wrong place. Despite intrinsically knowing that I contain multitudes, I fell into the trap of believing that a predefined role could satisfy me in a more holistic manner than possible.
</p>
<p>
I find that on a societal level this is a particularly pernicious problem. People have misguided expectations for their jobs, hobbies, and/or partners, and are disappointed whey then fail to live up to unrealistic hopes.*
</p>
<p>
However, there is an easy solution. One only needs to explicitly define what his/her needs are and then figure out where those needs can be met.
</p>
<p>
Personally, my requirements are:
</p>
<p>
1.	Physical & Mental health – Sleep, exercise, time to journal
2.	Close Relationships/Community – Having enough time to spend with my partner, loved ones, close friends, and the communities that matter to me
3.	Space to Express Myself – I need time to write, and to occasionally play guitar. Both are really cathartic and bring me a lot of joy.
4.	Time Outside
5.	Enough money to support my needs – Need to make some amount of money where I’m not worried about my day-to-day needs and can meet my long-term financial goals.
6.	Be able to make a contribution where I feel useful and important (Status) - I am still to a degree status seeking. I think I care much less about this than the average person, but I am no monk. I still need my work to feel important and useful, and I want to be acknowledged as being really good at whatever I do. Particularly in terms of my career & serious hobbies. I draw a thick line between the things I take seriously and the things that are for leisure.
7.	Mental Engagement – I like using my brain in a technical way where I’m solving hard problems. It’s a very specific type of challenge that people who have unlocked hard engineering, computer science, or math problems can relate to. And yes, this is a need, if I don’t do it I feel like I’m not using an important part of my self and I don’t feel good. It’s a very similar feeling to if you are fit and are forced to not workout for several days.
8.	Limited Exposure to bullshit  - shitty people, busy work, drudgery, unnecessary meetings, things that drain me. I need to minimize my exposure to this.
9.	Giving Back to the Community at large
</p>
<p>
Once my needs were well defined, the next step was to figure out where they could be met.
</p>
<p>
The first four: physical & mental health, time to express myself, close relationships and time outside are essentially all based on me having enough time and energy outside of work to do the things that matter to me. The only requirements here are that I work a job that’s around 40 hours a week. I’ve already put in the work to build communities, relationships, and hobbies that matter so this is just a matter of putting in the requisite energy to keep them going.
</p>
<p>
Giving back to the community is the thorniest one that I’ve had trouble with in the past. As previously mentioned, I’ve tried to group that in with my career with very low yields. It often conflicted with the point above, Limited Exposure to Bullshit, while compromising my earnings potential at work as well as my career status. To add insult to injury, I also had the gnawing feeling that I could be doing more Good if I separated that need from my day job entirely.
</p>
<p>
In an experiment to amend this friction, I decided to quit my old job. I’ve since gotten a new remote software engineering position with a very large company – Ford Motors. Based on reports from other employees I am essentially guaranteed to be working around 40 hour weeks, the money is good enough for what I need, it will raise my career status, allows me to learn useful skills, and should be mentally engaging.
</p>
<p>
There’s no overlap with my desire to do good. I think too many compromises need to be made at this stage in my life to also include that need within the umbrella of my career. Instead, I’ve decided to spend a few hours of every week to help Code for America. There are multiple civic tech projects that I think are very high impact and would love to be a part of. I toyed briefly with the idea of donating more money, but decided that since the amount of time I’d be willing to spend with Code for America x My Hourly Rate is an order of magnitude greater than my donation capacity, donating doesn’t make any sense.
</p>
<p>
There’s also a sense of win-win I feel with this version of Giving Back to the Community. Helping with Code for America will help me rise in my career, and potentially allow me to be a part of another great community. I find it’s really nice when your different needs have such a symbiotic relationship. It makes everything in my life feel like its in working harmoniously together to support an over arching life mission.
</p>
<p>
I’m just starting to apply this model, and hopefully it allows me to live a happier and more fulfilled life.
</p>
<p>
Please give it a shot! I’d love to know how this experiment works for you.
</p>
<p>
* Please note, I am NOT endorsing that anyone settle in any area of life. I’m simply saying that it’s not realistic to get your emotional needs met at work and it’s probably not a good idea to assume that your romantic partner is going to intellectually satisfy you in the same way hard math problems do. Seems like simple advice, but too many people including myself fall into the trap of false expectations.
