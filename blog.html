          Recently, there was an article on the front page of the NY Times titled <em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/07/opinion/google-job-harassment.html">After Working at Google, I&rsquo;ll Never Let Myself Love a Job Again</a></em>, the subtitle goes on to say &ldquo;I learned the hard way that no publicly traded company is a family&rdquo;. Immediately, I thought that the entire premise of this article was asinine. Who could ever equate a job with family?<br /><br /> Quickly, I remembered that I was in no position to judge, as I had been guilty of a similar folly not too long ago. Instead of looking for love from a company, I had wanted something from my startup job that was equally ludicrous &ndash; to give back to the world by trying to solve a fundamentally political issue: transitioning to clean energy. <br /><br /> At a high level, the problem is that I was looking to fulfill some need in the wrong place. Despite intrinsically knowing that I contain multitudes, I fell into the trap of believing that a predefined role could satisfy me in a more holistic manner than possible.</p>

          Dear Co-op Graduate,
          <p>

          Congratulations!
        </p>
          <p>
          I know this is not how you expected the end of your time in college to be, but I hope that despite the difficulties around us, you find the time to celebrate – you’ve earned it!
        </p>
        <p>
          As you stand on the precipice of adulthood (or at least a new form of adulthood if you are a non-traditional student), I would like to offer a few words of advice that have served me well over the years and are particularly useful for a graduate from the Berkeley Co-ops.
