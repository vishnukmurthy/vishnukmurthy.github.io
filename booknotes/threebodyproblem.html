  <b>8/10</b>
</p>
<p>
Overall, this book was a really fun, and well thought out sci fi read.
</p>
<p>
The premise is that a secret project by the Chinese government tries to make contact with extraterrestrial intelligence. Once the humans get a response back, a fundamental question is explored, what do we as humans do if contact with aliens is made?
</p>
<p>
What follows is an epic story showing the different sides of humanity, the factions that are created, and the line between science, dogma, and religion. Peppered throughout are full expositions on computers, artificial intelligence, astrophysics, and micro particles, all of which will satisfy even the nerdiest of sci fi fans.
</p>
<p>
One of the most interesting parts of this book is that it is set against the backdrop of the Cultural Revolution. Prior to doing any research, my knowledge on the topic was limited, but the translation by Ken Liu is great as there are plenty of footnotes explaining the historical and cultural references made. The characters embody the cultural background so well that since reading this book I’ve wanted to travel to China to understand the different outlooks between China and the USA. This ability to bridge the West and the East is no easy feat, and deserves recognition.
</p>
<p>
In terms of pace, this book is very similar to the Hunger Games Series. When I read it back in high school, a teacher described it as a “junk read”. I was offended at the time, because I loved the Hunger Games, but now I understand why. The pace of the book is such that there are no breaks or calm sections. The tension build is very good, but also never stops. One thing continually feeds into the next at a pace akin to an action movie.* To relate literature to food, it does feel like you are continually eating desserts and are continually in search of the next sugar rush.

“The one arm woman said, “There was a movie called Maple recently. I don’t know if you’ve seen it. At the end, an adult and a child stand in front of the grave of a Red Guard who had died during the faction civil wars. The child asks the adult, ‘Are they heroes?’ The adult says no. The child asks, ‘Are they enemies?’ The adult again says no. The child asks, ‘Then who are they?’ The adult says, ‘History’.”

“When It was finally quiet again, she was no longer capable of making any sound. She started at her father’s lifeless body, and the thoughts she could not voice dissolved into her blood where they would stay with her for the rest of her life. After the crowd dispersed, she remained like a stone statue, her body and limbs in the positions they were in when the two old janitors had held her back.”

  “What’s the point of worrying? We should learn to be as philosophical as Wei Cheng and Shi Qiang. Just do the best within your responsibility. Let’s go drinking and then go to sleep like good bugs.”

  “The ETO concluded that the common people did not seem to have the comprehensive and deep understanding of the highly educated about the dark side of humanity.”
</p>
<p>
“Our ideal is to invite the Trisolaran civilization to reform human civilization to curb human madness and evil, so that the Earth can once again become a harmonious, prosperous, sinless world.”

<p>
“What can I do now? What is the purpose of my life? I have four point five billion dollars and an international oil company. But what good is all that? Humans have surely invested more than forty-five billion dollars in saving species near extinction. And probably more than four hundred and fifty billion has already been spent on saving the environment from degradation. But what’s the use? Civilization continues to follow its path of destruction of all life on Earth except humans. Four point five billion is enough to build an aircraft carrier, but even if we build a thousand aircraft carriers, it would be impossible to stop the madness of humanity.”

   <b>My Thoughts (Filled with Spoilers):</b>
 </p>
 <p>
  <em>Humans Vs The Environment.</em>
</p>
<p>
Liu points to the modern incompatibility between humans and the environment. It is an important theme in his book and is one that I’ve thought a lot about in my life. There are no answers provided, but the book highlights the complexities involved in the issue and maybe admitting that there are no easy answers is an important first step in honestly taking on this problem.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Our Desire for God</em>
</p>
<p>
   When contact with the aliens is made, many people begin to treat the aliens as a Lord and someone who can help course correct humanity. Many of these people don’t believe in a traditional god, and it makes me think about the human need for hope and to believe that there is something higher than our minds, which we can use to orient ourselves in this harsh universe.
</p>
 <p>
  <em>Appreciation of the Fragility of this Earth</em><br>
</p>
<p>
  Theoretically, I understand that this life is so fragile, and that while life on other parts of the universe is possible and likely, it is still extremely rare. Conditions have to be met so exactly, and I think we often take this for granted. The novel shows an alternative planet with three suns that causes civilization to go between periods of extinction and thriving as it travels between the gravitational pull of the three suns via the famous mathematical
  <a href = "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-body_problem">Three Body Problem.</a>
</p>
<p>
The civilization never knows when the sun will rise or fall, and often goes through periods of extreme heat where everything is enflamed, and periods of extreme cold when everything freezes.
</p>
<p>
Reading about this parallel universe made me appreciate the delicate balance that exists on our planet a bunch more.
</p>

  <em>Perspective Based on Class</em><br>
</p>
<p>
When the video game is being played to draw the humans into the side of the Adventists, an observation is made by Wang – the Adventists seem to be all people from higher classes who understand the dark side of humanity better than the common person. When I read this I thought about a best books to read list that had a comparison between a list selected by authors and one selected by readers. The former had A Brave New World high up on the list, while the later had 1984. I will look to find that list.

* I think this book would actually make a very good movie. From my understanding it’s supposed to be made soon, but there have been licensing disagreements and the company that has the license has been slow on following through.
